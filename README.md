# Single-Client-Socket-using-UDP
This is the single client socket programming using UDP protocol in python

There are two codes- one for the server and the other for the client.
Using cmd or the python shell run the Server file first, this will create a UDP server
Next run the client file and then one can send messages from the client end to the server end and vice versa.
